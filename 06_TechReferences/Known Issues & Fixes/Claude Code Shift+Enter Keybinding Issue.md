## Problem

When running terminal setup commands in Claude Code, you may encounter the following error:

```
⎿  Found existing VSCode terminal Shift+Enter key binding. Remove it to continue.
   See /home/user/.config/Code/User/keybindings.json
```

This occurs when there's a conflicting Shift+Enter keybinding in the VSCode terminal that prevents proper terminal functionality.

## Solution

Add the following configuration to your VSCode keybindings:

1. Open VSCode
2. Go to **File > Preferences > Profiles**
3. Click the "Keyboard Shortcuts" 
4. Add this keybinding configuration:

```json
// Place your key bindings in this file to override the defaults
[
    {
        "key": "shift+enter",
        "command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence",
        "args": {
            "text": " \r\n",
        },
        "when": "terminalFocus"
    }
]
```

## What this does

- Binds Shift+Enter to send a space followed by a carriage return and newline to the terminal
- Only applies when the terminal has focus (`"when": "terminalFocus"`)
- Resolves conflicts with terminal setup scripts that expect specific Shift+Enter behavior

After adding this configuration, save the file and restart VSCode. The terminal setup should now work correctly.
